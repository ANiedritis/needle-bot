# needle-bot
<header>Discord bot that's going to do some automatic actions and maybe even listen to user commands, let's see where all this leads :)</header>

<p>Ok, so first of all, to invite bot and authorize it to server, we need to copy-paste this link</p>

        https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=600754355343458316&scope=bot&permissions=8
        
<p>Once that's opened, there option to choose server, well, choose wisely. Afterwards just hit "Authorise" button and you're all set!</p>


<span>Ok, so for now in order to run this bot it needs some local pc and console. From there it goes like this:</span>
<ul>
    <li>Locate the dir where the bot.js is</li>
    <li>write in conseole: node bot.js</li>
    <li>enjoy having bot alive</li>
    <li>in discord run command (and for now be happy it does something): !ping</li>
</ul>
    
<p>BUT... once the console is closed, or you want to do anything else with the open console, you kindof kill the bot, i guess... At least, in discord the bot isn't responding.</p>
