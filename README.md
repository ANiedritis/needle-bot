# needle-bot
Discord bot that's going to do some automatic actions and maybe even listen to user commands, let's see where all this leads :)

Ok, so first of all, to invite bot and authorize it to server, we need to copy-paste this link

        https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=600754355343458316&scope=bot&permissions=8
        
Once that's opened, there option to choose server, well, choose wisely. Afterwards just hit "Authorise" button and you're all set!
