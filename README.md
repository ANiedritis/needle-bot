# needle-bot
Discord bot that's going to do some automatic actions and maybe even listen to user commands, let's see where all this leads :)

Ok, so first of all, to invite bot and authorize it to server, we need to copy-paste this link

        https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=600754355343458316&scope=bot&permissions=8
        
Once that's opened, there option to choose server, well, choose wisely. Afterwards just hit "Authorise" button and you're all set!


Ok, so for now in order to run this bot it needs some local pc and console. From there it goes like this:
    - Locate the dir where the bot.js is
    - write in conseole: node bot.js
    - enjoy having bot alive
    - in discord run command (and for now be happy it does something): !ping
    
BUT... once the console is closed, or you want to do anything else with the open console, you kindof kill the bot, i guess... At least, in discord the bot isn't responding.
